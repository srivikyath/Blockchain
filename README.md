Introduction :
The article describes about the working of blockchain


About Blockchain :
Blockchain is a single decentralized ledger shared by all parties participating in an established, distributed network of computers. The ledger tracks the ownership and transfer of assets through the network. Each computer on the network has its copy of the Blockchain, allowing users to verify transactions quickly and prevent fraud.
In Blockchain, data is stored in transactions (called blocks). Every BlockBlock has a timestamp and a link to the BlockBlock that came before it. Each BlockBlock also includes mathematical proof verifying that a given transaction is valid (i.e., the sender has the right to send that amount of currency).

Front End :

IPFS ( Interplanetary File System ):
IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain
Large files cannot be efficiently stored on blockchains. On one hand side, the blockchain becomes bloated with data that has to be propagated within the blockchain network. On the other hand, since the blockchain is replicated on many nodes, a lot of storage space is required without serving an immediate purpose, especially if the node operator does not need to view every file that is stored on the blockchain. It furthermore leads to an increase in the price of operating blockchain nodes because more data needs to be processed, transferred and stored. IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain. Nonetheless, IPFS does not permit users to share files with selected parties. This is necessary, if sensitive or personal data needs to be shared. Therefore, this paper presents a modified version of the InterPlanetary Filesystem (IPFS) that leverages Ethereum smart contracts to provide access controlled file sharing. The smart contract is used to maintain the access control list, while the modified IPFS software enforces it. For this, it interacts with the smart contract whenever a file is uploaded, downloaded or transferred. Using an experimental setup, the impact of the access controlled IPFS is analyzed and discussed.
